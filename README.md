# Defining Data Governance

*What is meant by governance?*
Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable. 

*What is data governance?*
Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.

*Data Governance Versus Data Management*
Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

*Data Governance versus Information Governance*
 Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

 *The Value of Data Governance*
Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data


  *Creating a Data Governance Program*
The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course.

- Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
- Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
- Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
- Achieving leadership approval.
- Designing and developing the program.
- Implementing the program.
- Monitoring and measuring performance.
- Maintaining the program.

# Developing a Data Governance Framework
While there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

*The most important qualities of a data governance framework.*
- Leadership and Strategy
- Roles and Responsibilities
- Policies, Processes, and standard
- Metrics
- Tools
- Communication and Collection

     *Leadership and Strategy*
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. 
- Ensuring senoir leadership support and aligning data governance efforts with the vision, mission, and strategy of the organization.

       *Roles and Responsibilities*
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
- Identifying and empowering the right team members with responsibilities for the data governance program and others with accountability for data.

      *Policies, Processes, and standards*
Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.
- Developing and enforcing the policies, processes, and standards for governing and managiging data.
  
      *Metrics*
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
- Measuring and reporting on the perfomance of the data governance program and the broader outcomes of data management activities.
  
      *Tools*
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 
- Deploying and utilizing a range of software-based tools to support data governance and management.
  
    *Communication and Collection*
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
- Adopting specific methods for high-performance communications and collaboration in support of data governance and management.

# Preparing for Data Governance
It might seem a good idea just to form a team, create a plan, buy some tools, and then implement data governance. That would be a mistake. Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.

    *What is data culture?*
A Data Culture is the collective behaviors and beliefs of people who value, practice, and encourage the use of data to improve decision-making.

    *Assessing the Data Culture*
On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture).

# Maturing the Data Culture
If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start. Good news! Many of these items are covered in detail in this course. 

Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.

       Assessing Data Governance Readiness

The following basic checklist of items will help you determine the data governance readiness of your organization:

- The basis of a data culture exists.
- The program is 100 percent aligned with business strategy.
- Senior leadership is 100 percent committed to the program and its goals.
- Senior leadership understands this is a strategic, enterprise program and not the sole responsibility of the IT department.
- One or more sponsors have been identified at an executive level.
- The program has the commitment to fund its creation and to maintain it in the long term.
- The organization understands this is an ongoing program and not a one-off project.
- You have documented the return-on-investment (ROI).
- Legal and compliance teams (internally or externally) understand and support the goals of the program.
- Fundamental data skills exist for the data governance journey.
- The IT organization is capable and resourced to support the program.

# Exploring a World Overflowing with Data 
                 Defining Data

Data is information such as facts and numbers used to analyze something or make decisions. *data governance is not the same as data management.* data governance establishes policies and procedures around data, while data management enacts those policies and procedures to compile and use that data for decision-making. 

              Why all the focus on data?
Data refers to collections of digitally stored units, in other words, stuff that is kept on a computing device. These units represent something meaningful when processed for a human or a computer. Single units of data are traditionally referred to as datum and multiple units as data. However, the term data is often used in singular and plural contexts and, in this course, We are going to simply refer to both as data. 

         *Data is also defined based on its captured format. Specifically, at a high level, it falls into one of the following categories:*
- Structured: Data that has been formatted to a set structure; each data unit fits nicely into a table in a database. It’s ready for analysis. Examples include first name, last name, and phone number.
- Unstructured: Data that are stored in a native format must be processed to be used. Further work is required to enable analysis. Examples include email content and social media posts.
- Semi-structured: Data that contains additional information to enable the native format to be searched and analyzed.

Today, the term data processing has been replaced with information technology (IT).

          *Welcome to The Zettabyte Era*
Today, we live in the zettabyte era. A zettabyte is a big number. A really big number. It’s 1021, or a 1 with 21 zeros after it. It looks like this: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.

           From Data to Insight
When we apply information coupled with broader contextual concepts, practical application, and experience, it becomes knowledge. Knowledge is actionable. It may also give relevance to the saying that- knowledge is power. To go further than this. When we take new knowledge and apply reasoning, values, and the broader universe of our knowledge and deep experiences, we get wisdom. With wisdom, we know what to do with knowledge and can determine its contextual validity. We could have stopped at knowledge, but wisdom takes us to the ultimate destination derived from data. All wisdom includes knowledge, but not all knowledge is wisdom. 

           Data-Driven Decision-Making
Perhaps one of the greatest values of data is its ability to help us all make better decisions. Intuitively reading the customer reviews of a restaurant on a website such as Hello Peter or Google Reviews can help you decide whether you want to eat there. It’s valuable to you, but it’s also valuable to the restaurant owner. Those reviews can make a big difference, including being a motivation for action. Perhaps the restrooms should be cleaner.

           Data as The New Oil
A popular refrain coined by the mathematician Clive Humby in 2006 is that data is the new oil. Just as oil drove and grew economies in the past, data is doing that now. Some have subsequently added that just like oil, data has value but must first be processed to be useful. Specifically, oil is refined to make gas, plastics, and other useful chemicals. In a similar fashion, data must be organized and analyzed to understand patterns, make decisions, identify problems, and feed other systems.

          Data ownership
Data ownership describes the rights a person, team, or organization has over one or more data sets. These rights may span from lightweight oversight and control to rigorous rules that are legally enforceable. For example, data associated with intellectual property — items such as copyrights and trade secrets — will likely have high degrees of protection, from accessibility rights to who can use the data and for what purpose.

             Data Architecture
When designing the technical needs of an organization to support its business strategy, this practice is known as enterprise architecture (EA). Using standards and established principles, organizations can analyze, design, plan, and implement the right technologies, policies, and projects to support business goals.

A subset of EA is data architecture. In the same manner, which you can consider the holistic nature of EA in support of the organization’s strategy, data architecture is the manner in which data design and management decisions are being made to align with EA and in turn, with the business. Simply stated, data architecture is the agreed blueprint for how data supports an organization’s functions and technologies.

At a minimum, data architecture considers and typically supports the following:

- Ensuring data is available to those who need it and are approved to use it.
- Reducing the complexity of accessing and utilizing data
- Creating and enforcing data protections to support organizational policies and obligations.
- Adopting and agreeing to data standards
- Optimizing the flow and efficient use of data to eliminate bottlenecks and duplication

**Data architecture** is a direct reflection of data governance. An established and functioning data architecture immediately signals that an organization values data, manages it as a critical business asset, and has controls in place to ensure that it aligns with business needs. Indeed, like EA, data architecture is not the exclusive realm of technologists but a cross-organizational responsibility.

             The Lifecycle of Data
1. **Creation:**  This is the stage at which data comes into being. It may be manual or automated and get created internally or externally. Data is created all the time by a vast number of activities that include system inputs and outputs.
2. **Storage:**  Once data is created and assuming you want it available for later use, it must be stored. It most likely will be contained and managed in a database. The database needs a home, too as a local hard drive, server, or cloud service.
3. **Usage:**  Hopefully you’re capturing and storing data because you want to use it. Maybe not immediately, but at some point, perhaps for analysis. Data may need to be processed to be useful. That could include cleansing it of errors, transforming it to another format, and securing access rights.
4. **Archival:**  In this stage, you identify data that is not currently being used and move it to a long-term storage system out of your production environment. If it's needed at some point in the future, it can be retrieved and utilized.
5. **Destruction:**  Despite a desire by some to keep everything forever, there is a logical point where destruction makes sense or is required by regulation or policy. Data destruction involves making data inaccessible and unreadable. It can include the physical destruction of a device such as a hard drive.

          Defining Big Data
**Big data** is structured and unstructured data that is so massive and complex in scale, that it’s difficult and often impossible to process via traditional data management techniques.

**One way to define and characterize big data is through these five Vs:**

- Volume: The sheer scale of data being produced is unprecedented and requires new tools, skills, and processes.
- Variety: There are already a lot of legacy file formats, such as CSV and MP3, and with new innovations, new formats are emerging all the time. This requires different methods of handling, from analysis to security.
- Velocity: With so many collection points, digital interfaces, and ubiquitous connectivity, data is being created and moved at increasing speed. Consider that in 2021, Instagram users created, uploaded, and share 65,000 pictures a minute.
- Variability:  The fact that the creation and flow of data are unpredictable.
- Veracity:  The quality, including accuracy and truthfulness, of large volume of disparate sets of data, can differ considerably, causing challenges to data management.

         Drivers of Big Data
Big data was a thing even before Android and Apple smartphones and apps started generating data. This was before we had connected billions of devices, called the Internet of Things (IoTs), which would eventually begin collecting all manner of data. Big data even predates videos of cats published every day on social media platforms.
- Internet of Things (IoT): The proliferation of connected devices generates enormous amounts of data. Everything from smart appliances to industrial sensors contributes to the Big Data landscape.


         Consequences of Big Data
While these big data statistics are impressive, they don’t really paint the full picture. It might be easy, for example, to assume that all the data is good quality. You might believe it is easy to analyze. You may even think it is easily accessible. Most of these assumptions and many related ones will likely be incorrect. For starters, up to 80 percent of data is unstructured. That’s a challenge right there. The vast majority of organizations struggle with unstructured data. In addition, a lot of this data is duplicative. Some of it will be bad data, which means it can’t be trusted, has errors, or includes some other substantive challenge.


         What about small data?
  Big questions can be answered in small data.

In fact, big data is often more meaningful when broken into smaller, more manageable chunks - an increasingly popular definition of small data. Smaller, logically arranged data can be the way to make sense of big data. In some circumstances, it may be the only way.


         Enter the Realm of Smart Data
Smart data has emerged as a new term that defines big data that’s been optimally prepared for use to deliver the highest business value. Instead of being overwhelmed by the distractions inherent to the volume, velocity, and variety of data in big data sets, processes are applied to big data to prepare it for specific uses. For example, marketing teams can target potential customers with precision. Analytics applications can use high-quality real-time data generated in a manufacturing setting.
**In the 21st century we must recognize that all data can have value — big, small, and smart. Data governance is concerned with data no matter what form it takes.**
