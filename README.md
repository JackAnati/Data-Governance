# Defining Data Governance

*What is meant by governance?*
Governance is the manner in which an entity chooses to oversee the control and direction of an area of interest. It typically takes the form of how decisions are made, regulated, and enforced. When entities grow and increase in complexity, formal governance becomes important. Left ungoverned, the possibility of devolving into chaos is very probable. 

*What is data governance?*
Data governance is all about managing data well, but data governance is not restricted to only data management.

*Data Governance Versus Data Management*
Data governance is focused on roles and responsibilities, policies, definitions, metrics, and the lifecycle of data. Data management is the technical implementation of data governance. For example, databases, data warehouses and lakes, application programming interfaces (APIs), analytics software, encryption, data crunching, and architectural design and implementation are all data management features and functions.

*Data Governance versus Information Governance*
 Data governance generally focuses on data, independent of its meaning. For example, you may want to govern the security of patient data and staff data from a policy and process perspective, despite their differences. Information governance is entirely concerned with the meaning of the data and its relationship in terms of outcomes and value to the organization, customers, and other stakeholders.

 *The Value of Data Governance*
Fundamentally, data governance is driven by a desire to increase the value of data and reduce the risks associated with it. It forces a leap from an ad hoc approach to data to one that is strategic in nature.

Some of the main advantages achieved by good data governance include:

- Improved data quality
- Expanded data value
- Increased data compliance
- Improved data-driven decision-making
- Enhanced business performance
- Greater sharing and use of data across the enterprise and externally
- Increased data availability and accessibility
- Improved data search
- Reduced risks from data-related issues
- Reduced data management costs
- Established rules for handling data


  *Creating a Data Governance Program*
The basic steps for creating a data governance program consist of the following. These steps also form the basic outline of this course.

- Defining the vision, goals, and benefits.
- Analyzing the current state of data governance and management.
- Developing a proposal based on the first two steps, including a draft plan.
- Achieving leadership approval.
- Designing and developing the program.
- Implementing the program.
- Monitoring and measuring performance.
- Maintaining the program.

# Developing a Data Governance Framework
While there are many framework variations to choose from, including ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) IT governance framework, they share some common components that address people, processes, and technology.

*The most important qualities of a data governance framework.*
- Leadership and Strategy
- Roles and Responsibilities
- Policies, Processes, and standard
- Metrics
- Tools
- Communication and Collection

     *Leadership and Strategy*
Your data governance program must be aligned with the strategy of the organization. 
- Ensuring senoir leadership support and aligning data governance efforts with the vision, mission, and strategy of the organization.

       *Roles and Responsibilities*
Your data governance program will only be possible with the right people doing the right things at the right time.
- Identifying and empowering the right team members with responsibilities for the data governance program and others with accountability for data.

      *Policies, Processes, and standards*
Policies, processes, and standards must include accountability and enforcement components; otherwise it’s possible they will be dead on arrival.
- Developing and enforcing the policies, processes, and standards for governing and managiging data.
  
      *Metrics*
The data governance program must have a mechanism to measure whether it is delivering the expected results. Capturing metrics and delivering them to a variety of stakeholders is important for maintaining support, which includes funding.
- Measuring and reporting on the perfomance of the data governance program and the broader outcomes of data management activities.
  
      *Tools*
Fortunately, a large marketplace now exists for tools in support of data governance and management. These include tools for master data management, data catalogs, search, security, integration, analytics, and compliance. 
- Deploying and utilizing a range of software-based tools to support data governance and management.
  
    *Communication and Collection*
With the introduction of data governance and the ongoing, sometimes evolving, requirements, high-quality communications are key. This takes many forms, including in-person meetings, emails, newsletters, and workshops. Change management, in particular, requires careful attention to ensure that impacted team members understand how the changes brought about by the data governance program affect them and their obligations.
- Adopting specific methods for high-performance communications and collaboration in support of data governance and management.

# Preparing for Data Governance
It might seem a good idea just to form a team, create a plan, buy some tools, and then implement data governance. That would be a mistake. Data governance requires careful treatment, beginning with understanding whether an organization is ready to accept it. Being ready as an organization involves determining the extent to which a data culture exists. Intuitively you can conclude that an immature, reactive data culture, where data is simply handled in an ad hoc manner, is an entirely different experience than a sophisticated data-driven culture.

    *What is data culture?*
A Data Culture is the collective behaviors and beliefs of people who value, practice, and encourage the use of data to improve decision-making.

    *Assessing the Data Culture*
On a basic level, data culture is how your organization values data and how it manages and uses it. There’s a wide chasm between companies that simply manage data as a consequence of doing business versus those that consider data central to how their organization operates and makes decisions (the latter being the qualities exhibited by a mature data culture).

# Maturing the Data Culture
If you decide that you need to better prepare the organization for data governance by maturing the data culture, consider these items to start. Good news! Many of these items are covered in detail in this course. 

Help leaders communicate the value of data and model the type of behavior that demonstrates that data is a priority. This must include communicating the positive results of using data.
Provide basic tools and education for data use that include manipulating data, analytics, data cleansing, basic query commands, and visualization. Don’t overlook the remarkable capabilities of common applications such as spreadsheets.
Do something, even if it’s small, to show progress. A successful data culture doesn’t begin with the deployment of complex, far-reaching solutions. Rather, it can be eased into the organization via basic data-management skills offered in a classroom setting or online.
Recognize that resistance and frustration are part of the journey. Rather than fighting it, find ways to bring comfort and rewards to team members. At a minimum, provide a channel for feedback and positive discussion.
